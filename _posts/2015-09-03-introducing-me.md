title: Introducing My GitHub Page
---

Bonjour tout le monde! Welcome to my page! I recently decided it would be really cool to create a page where I could 
talk about interesting code snippets and programming problems that I run into. This page is currently hosted on Github 
pages, just because it's super simple to setup and I wanted to try messing with Jekyll (Jekyll is powering this blog). 

In the hamburger menu on the left side you'll find more information about my general work history and interests. I'd 
love to hear from people who read this blog so feel free to contact me with any programming questions or interesting 
comments/opportunities.
