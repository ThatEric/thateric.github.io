## Summary
Hi, I'm a full stack web developer that originally went to school for electrical engineering.
I originally was focused on working as an engineer, but quickly fell in love with web development after I graduated.
Right now I am interested in all forms of programming.

I have been called a coding hipster by coworkers because I really love following and implementing current programming 
trends and frameworks. I generally work in the backend in SQL and C#, but I also really enjoy working in the front end, 
particularly using React.js.

My current pet project is written in JavaScript using Node.js running on AWS storing it's data primarily in DynamoDB.
My previous personal projects were written in Python using Flask running on DigitalOcean and using PostgreSQL.
