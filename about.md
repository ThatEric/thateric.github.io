I'm a Web Developer that graduated with an MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UCSB.
I originally was focused on working as an Electrical Engineer, but quickly fell in love with web development after I graduated.
Right now I am interested in all forms of programming, but I focus mostly on web apps and mobile development in my free time.
My most used languages are C#, TSQL, and JavaScript, but I have also built web apps with a wide variety of languages, frameworks, and databases.
I love learning new languages and techniques so I'm always switching up my project tools.
My current pet site is written in JavaScript using Node.js running on AWS storing it's data primarily in DynamoDB.
My previous pet site was written in Python using Flask running on DigitalOcean and using PostgreSQL.

## School

Major: Electrical engineering with an emphasis on control systems, signals, and circuit design.
