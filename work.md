## Current
Full Stack Web Developer at CAKE in Newport Beach, CA

> I am currently working at CAKE and have been since 2013. While here I have helped develop several distinct web 
applications that receive and report on an extremely large amount of web traffic. I originally primarily focused on C# 
and JavaScript as a Technical Owner, but recently I have shifted to a more full stack role with my time split between 
C#/JavaScript and SQL Server development and support.

## Past
Web Developer at Phenomenex in Torrance, CA

> I previously worked at Phenomenex from 2010 to 2013. As a member of a small development team I helped develop a 
complex Microsoft Azure eCommerce site from scratch in a full stack role using C#, Javascript/jQuery, and SQL. At first 
I focused mostly on frontend and backend development, but slowly my role grew to managing the site including 
deployments, adding in new complex functionality, and localization.
